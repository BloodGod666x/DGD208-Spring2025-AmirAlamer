I included an exe to make it easier because its quite a mess to be honest.
I did many updates on the game but for the life of me I cant seem to make GitHub work the way I want it to.
I wanted to add a lot more systems cause it was a lot of fun and I might do that and send u the files on an email. I hope you read all this, I know you're busy sir but thank you!

Also the name Pet Simulatorsss wasn't the intended name for the game it was just the name of the project when I created it but I kinda like it now xD.
